 * A basic round-robin tournament
 * system.  It facilitates creation of a tournament and the 
 * adding of players to tournaments.  Note that although every player
 * plays against every other player as both home and away, we do not
 * guarantee an ordering of the matches via rounds for example.
 * The reason is that a player (or student) might show up late or
 * a specific match might crash and we don't want to hold up the rest
 * of the tournament.  So, match selection will be done by availability
 * of the two opposing players.  Whenever a match can be played, it will
 * be played - as long as the tournament is active.
